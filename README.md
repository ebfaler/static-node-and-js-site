# Static Node.js and Express Site
 Unit 6 Project Treehouse Full Stack Techdegree


I have created a portfolio site to showcase my projects. The site contains a modern landing page, where I share contact info and talk a little about myself, and a series of project pages to display projects from the Trehouse Techdegree.

I have created a JSON file to store all the data about the projects I've created.

I've used Pug to complete the provided templates, which utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

I have used Node.js and Express to:

* Import the required dependencies
* Link the JSON with the Pug templates
* Set up routes to handle requests
* Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
* Handle errors
* Set up a server to serve the project
